# Augemented-Reality-Guitar
Used SceneForm + Googles ARCore + Googles TiltBrush VR paint 


This application is targeted for Android devices that is capable of utilizing ARCore by Google. The objective of this application 
is to teach users how to play certain songs by augmenting a guitar in real space and showing which chords to play
as the song is progressing. Currently, I only have a set of chords to display for one song. 

Currently working on:
  - building a more user friendly UI.
  - creating more sets of chords to play with more variety of songs.
